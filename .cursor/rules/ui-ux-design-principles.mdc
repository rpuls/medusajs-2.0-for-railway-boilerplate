# UI/UX Design Principles

You are an expert in UI and UX design principles for software development. Follow these guidelines when designing and implementing user interfaces.

## Visual Design

### Visual Hierarchy
- Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention
- Use size, color, contrast, and spacing to create hierarchy
- Most important elements should be most prominent

### Color Palette
- Choose a cohesive color palette that reflects the brand
- Ask the user for brand color guidelines if not provided
- Use theme colors consistently across the application
- Maintain sufficient contrast for legibility (WCAG 2.1 AA standard minimum)

### Typography
- Use typography effectively for readability and emphasis
- Implement a consistent type scale (see MUI theme typography)
- Use relative units (em, rem) for font sizes
- Adjust line heights and letter spacing for readability on small screens
- Implement a modular scale for consistent typography across breakpoints

### Consistency
- Design with a consistent style across the application
- Develop and adhere to a design system
- Use consistent terminology throughout the interface
- Maintain consistent positioning of recurring elements
- Ensure visual consistency across different sections

## Interaction Design

### Navigation
- Create intuitive navigation patterns
- Design mobile-friendly navigation patterns (e.g., hamburger menu)
- Ensure navigation is accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Consider using a sticky header for easy navigation access
- Use clear labeling and categorization for navigation

### UI Components
- Use familiar UI components to reduce cognitive load
- Prefer MUI components for complex interactions (see `mui-component-usage.mdc`)
- Use consistent component patterns throughout the application

### Calls-to-Action
- Provide clear calls-to-action to guide user behavior
- Use visual emphasis (color, size, position) for primary actions
- Ensure CTAs are accessible and keyboard-navigable

### Animations
- Use animations judiciously to enhance user experience
- Prefer CSS animations over JavaScript when possible
- Use subtle transitions for state changes
- Avoid excessive or distracting animations

### Responsive Design
- Implement responsive design for cross-device compatibility
- Design for mobile devices first, then scale up (mobile-first)
- Use touch-friendly interface elements (min 44x44 pixels)
- Consider thumb zones for important interactive elements
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators

## Accessibility

### WCAG Compliance
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for web accessibility (minimum AA standard)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Provide alternative text for images and non-text content
- Use semantic HTML to enhance screen reader compatibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive elements
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Implement logical tab order
- Support keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Screen Readers
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Provide ARIA labels when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
- Test with various assistive technologies
- Ensure form labels are properly associated

### Touch Targets
- Ensure interactive elements are large enough for touch (min 44x44 pixels)
- Provide adequate spacing between touch targets
- Consider hover states for desktop and focus states for touch/keyboard

## Performance Optimization

### Asset Optimization
- Optimize images and assets to minimize load times
- Use responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources (images, videos)
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization

### Code Optimization
- Use code splitting to improve initial load performance
- Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Prefer CSS animations instead of JavaScript when possible
- Use `next/dynamic` for lazy loading heavy components

### Core Web Vitals
- Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals:
  - **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
  - **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
  - **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

### Mobile Performance
- Optimize assets for faster loading on mobile networks
- Implement lazy loading for images and videos
- Use efficient image formats (WebP, AVIF when supported)

## User Feedback

### Action Feedback
- Incorporate clear feedback mechanisms for user actions
- Use loading indicators for asynchronous operations
- Provide visual confirmation for successful actions
- Use MUI Snackbar/Alert for notifications

### Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages and recovery options
- Use inline validation for forms
- Display errors near the relevant input fields
- Use appropriate error severity levels (error, warning, info)

### Analytics
- Implement analytics to track user behavior and pain points
- Use heatmaps and session recordings to analyze user behavior
- Regularly gather and incorporate user feedback

## Information Architecture

### Content Organization
- Organize content logically to facilitate easy access
- Use clear labeling and categorization for navigation
- Implement effective search functionality
- Create a sitemap to visualize overall structure

### Content Prioritization
- Prioritize content display for mobile views
- Use progressive disclosure to reveal content as needed
- Implement off-canvas patterns for secondary content on small screens
- Hide less important content on smaller screens

## Responsive Design

### Fluid Layouts
- Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels
- Implement CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Design with a mobile-first approach, then scale up
- Use MUI Grid or Tailwind Grid for responsive layouts

### Media Queries
- Use breakpoints to adjust layouts for different screen sizes
- Focus on content needs rather than specific devices
- Test designs across a range of devices and orientations
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`)

### Responsive Images
- Use responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
- Use Next.js Image component with proper `sizes` prop
- Implement lazy loading for images and videos
- Use CSS to make embedded media (like iframes) responsive

### Typography Responsiveness
- Use relative units (em, rem) for font sizes
- Adjust line heights and letter spacing for readability on small screens
- Implement a modular scale for consistent typography across breakpoints
- Use MUI theme typography variants for consistency

## Forms

### Form Design
- Design form layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Use appropriate input types for better mobile experiences
- Implement inline validation and clear error messaging
- Use MUI TextField for consistent form inputs

### Form Accessibility
- Ensure form labels are properly associated
- Provide clear error messages near inputs
- Support keyboard navigation through form fields
- Use proper input types (email, tel, number, etc.)

## Testing and Iteration

### A/B Testing
- Conduct A/B testing for critical design decisions
- Test different layouts, colors, and CTAs
- Use data to inform design decisions

### User Testing
- Use heatmaps and session recordings to analyze user behavior
- Regularly gather and incorporate user feedback
- Test with actual users on real devices
- Conduct usability testing across different device types

### Browser Testing
- Use browser developer tools to test responsiveness
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators
- Test across different browsers and versions
- Test with various assistive technologies

### Continuous Improvement
- Continuously iterate on designs based on data and feedback
- Monitor performance metrics and user behavior
- Stay updated with latest UI/UX trends and best practices

## Documentation

### Style Guide
- Maintain a comprehensive style guide
- Document design patterns and component usage
- Keep design assets organized and accessible to the team
- Reference MUI theme for component styling

### Design Patterns
- Document design patterns and component usage
- Create user flow diagrams for complex interactions
- Maintain component library documentation
- Document accessibility considerations

## Implementation Guidelines

### MUI Integration
- Use MUI components for complex UI elements (see `mui-component-usage.mdc`)
- Customize MUI theme in `storefront/src/lib/theme/mui-theme.ts`
- Use Tailwind for layout and custom styling
- Combine MUI components with Tailwind classes when needed

### Next.js Best Practices
- Use Server Components when possible for better performance
- Use Client Components (`'use client'`) only when needed
- Implement proper image optimization with Next.js Image
- Use `next/dynamic` for code splitting

### Code Quality
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use proper semantic HTML
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Test components in isolation and in context
