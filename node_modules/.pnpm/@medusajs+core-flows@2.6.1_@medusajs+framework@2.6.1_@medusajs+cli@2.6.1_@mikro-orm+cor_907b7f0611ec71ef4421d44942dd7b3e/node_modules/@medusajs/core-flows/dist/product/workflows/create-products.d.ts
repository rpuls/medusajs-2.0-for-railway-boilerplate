 * This workflow creates one or more products. It's used by the [Create Product Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#products_postproducts).
 * It can also be useful to you when creating [seed scripts](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/custom-cli-scripts/seed-data), for example.
 *
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the created products. You can see an example in [this guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/product/extend).
 *
 * You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product creation.
