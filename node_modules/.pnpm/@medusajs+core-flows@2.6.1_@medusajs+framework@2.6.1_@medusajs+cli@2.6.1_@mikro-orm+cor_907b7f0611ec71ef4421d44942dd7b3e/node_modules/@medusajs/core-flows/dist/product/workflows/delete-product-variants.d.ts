 * This workflow deletes one or more product variants. It's used by the
 * [Delete Product Variants Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#products_deleteproductsidvariantsvariant_id).
 *
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the product variants are deleted. For example,
 * you can delete custom records linked to the product variants.
 *
 * You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around product-variant deletion.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await deleteProductVariantsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     ids: ["variant_123"],
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Delete one or more product variants.
 *
 * @property hooks.productVariantsDeleted - This hook is executed after the variants are deleted. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the deleted variants.
