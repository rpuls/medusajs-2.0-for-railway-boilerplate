 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await refreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {

 * Refresh a cart's shipping methods after an update.
 *
 * @property hooks.validate - This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.
