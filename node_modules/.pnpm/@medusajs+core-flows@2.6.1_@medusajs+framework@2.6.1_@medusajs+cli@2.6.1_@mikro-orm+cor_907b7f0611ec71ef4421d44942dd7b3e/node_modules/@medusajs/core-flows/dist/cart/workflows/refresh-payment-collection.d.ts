 * This workflow refreshes a cart's payment collection, which is useful once the cart is created or when its details
 * are updated. If the cart's total changes to the amount in its payment collection, the payment collection's payment sessions are
 * deleted. It also syncs the payment collection's amount, currency code, and other details with the details in the cart.
 *
 * This workflow is used by other cart-related workflows, such as the {@link refreshCartItemsWorkflow} to refresh the cart's
 * payment collection after an update.
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to refresh the cart's payment collection after making updates to it in your
 * custom flows.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await refreshPaymentCollectionForCartWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     cart_id: "cart_123",
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Refresh a cart's payment collection details.
 *
 * @property hooks.validate - This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.
