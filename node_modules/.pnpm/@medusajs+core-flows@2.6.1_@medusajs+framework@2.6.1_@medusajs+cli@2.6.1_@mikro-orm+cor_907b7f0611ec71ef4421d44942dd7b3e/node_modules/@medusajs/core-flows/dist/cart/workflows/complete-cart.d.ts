 * This workflow completes a cart and places an order for the customer. It's executed by the
 * [Complete Cart Store API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store#carts_postcartsidcomplete).
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around completing a cart.
 * For example, in the [Subscriptions recipe](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/recipes/subscriptions/examples/standard#create-workflow),
 * this workflow is used within another workflow that creates a subscription order.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await completeCartWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     id: "cart_123"
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Complete a cart and place an order.
 *
 * @property hooks.validate - This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.
