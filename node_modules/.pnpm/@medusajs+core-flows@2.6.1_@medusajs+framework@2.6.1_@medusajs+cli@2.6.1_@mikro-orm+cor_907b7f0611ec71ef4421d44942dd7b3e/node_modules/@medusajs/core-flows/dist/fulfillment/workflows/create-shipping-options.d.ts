/**
 * This workflow creates one or more shipping options. It's used by the
 * [Create Shipping Option Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options_postshippingoptions).
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to
 * create shipping options within your custom flows.
 *
 * @example
 * To calculate a shipping option with flat rate prices:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { result } = await createShippingOptionsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: [
 *     {
 *       name: "Standard Shipping",
 *       service_zone_id: "serzo_123",
 *       shipping_profile_id: "sp_123",
 *       provider_id: "prov_123",
 *       type: {
 *         label: "Standard",
 *         description: "Standard shipping",
 *         code: "standard"
 *       },
 *       price_type: "flat",
 *       prices: [
 *         {
 *           amount: 500,
 *           currency_code: "usd"
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ]
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * To calculate shipping option with calculated prices, set `price_type` to `calculated` and don't pass a `prices` array:
 *
 * :::note
 *
 * You can calculate the shipping option's price for a cart using the [calculateShippingOptionsPricesWorkflow](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/references/medusa-workflows/calculateShippingOptionsPricesWorkflow).
 *
 * :::
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { result } = await createShippingOptionsWorkflow(container)

 *     {
 *       name: "Standard Shipping",

 *       shipping_profile_id: "sp_123",
 *       provider_id: "prov_123",
 *       type: {
 *         label: "Standard",
 *         description: "Standard shipping",
 *         code: "standard"
 *       },
 *       price_type: "calculated",
 *     }
 *   ]
