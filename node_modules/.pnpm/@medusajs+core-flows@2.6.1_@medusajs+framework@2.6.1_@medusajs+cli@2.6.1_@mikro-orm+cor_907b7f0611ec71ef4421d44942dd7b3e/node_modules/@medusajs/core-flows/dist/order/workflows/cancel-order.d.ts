/**
 * This workflow cancels an order. An order can only be canceled if it doesn't have
 * any fulfillments, or if all fulfillments are canceled. The workflow will also cancel
 * any uncaptured payments, and refund any captured payments.
 *
 * This workflow is used by the [Cancel Order Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#orders_postordersidcancel).
 *
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions on the canceled order. For example, you can
 * make changes to custom models linked to the order.
 *
 * You can also use this workflow within your customizations or your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around canceling an order.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await cancelOrderWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     order_id: "order_123",
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Cancel an order.
 *
 * @property hooks.orderCanceled - This hook is executed after the order is canceled. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the canceled order.
